                    <p><strong>Review Excerpt:</strong>As someone who's deeply invested in technology, logic and decision making, I often find myself seeking out books that help me better understand how we, as humans, process information and make choices.</p>

			<p>As someone who is passionate about technology and decision making I recently read Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and it has become one of my favorite non fiction books. The book explains how we think in two main ways fast intuitive decisions called System 1 and slow logical thinking called System 2. While System 1 helps us make quick decisions it is also the source of many biases and errors. System 2 is more deliberate and requires effort which often leads us to default to System 1 when we should be thinking more carefully.

Kahneman also discusses cognitive biases like the planning fallacy which explains why we often underestimate the time and resources needed for tasks. As a software engineer this insight has been invaluable in improving my approach to problem solving and project management. In a fast paced world it is easy to make quick decisions but the book reminds me of the power of slowing down and engaging in more reflective thinking.

This shift in mindset has helped me make better choices both professionally and personally. Thinking Fast and Slow is an eye opening read that has helped me better understand my decision making process and become more mindful in the way I approach complex challenges.

                    <strong>Review Excerpt:</strong> Why We Sleep isn’t just a book, it’s a wake up call (no pun intended) to how powerful sleep really is. If you want to feel better, think clearer and get more done, it’s time to give sleep the respect it deserves 😴✨</p>

			<p>Let’s get real we have all been there staying up late cramming binge watching Netflix and convincing ourselves that sleep is overrated. But Dr Matthew Walker’s *Why We Sleep* is here to set us straight. Sleep is not just downtime. It is when your brain gets to work processing memories organizing information and clearing out toxins. Skimp on sleep and your brain runs on fumes which is not exactly ideal when you have a project deadline or an exam staring at you.

Lack of sleep does more than make you tired. It affects your mood your cognitive function and even your immune system. If you want to stay sharp healthy and not snap at everyone around you sleep is your secret weapon. Walker explains how modern life has quietly turned many of us into sleep deprived zombies. Late night screen time early morning meetings and constant notifications all throw off our natural circadian rhythms.

The good news is that we can fight back. Naps are not lazy. They are powerful brain boosters that improve memory and creativity. Those vivid dreams you barely remember in the morning are not random either. They help your brain process emotions and consolidate memories in ways you probably did not realize were happening.

The book feels like a wake up call in the best way. Sleep is not a waste of time. It is essential. Walker shares practical advice such as putting your phone away before bed and sticking to a consistent sleep schedule. He also makes a strong case for a cultural shift in how we think about rest and productivity.

If you want to think more clearly feel better and get more done start by respecting your sleep. Pick up this book and give your brain the recovery time it deserves. You will thank yourself later.
 😴✨</p>

                        <p>Ray Bradbury’s The Martian Chronicles is more than just a collection of sci-fi stories about Mars—it’s a deep exploration of humanity’s flaws, desires and struggles. Published in 1950, the book blends the wonder of space exploration with poetic prose, tackling timeless themes like colonization, war, identity and alienation. Bradbury uses Mars as a mirror for Earth, showing how our destructive tendencies, like greed and fear, follow us even into the unknown. The stories explore how humans colonize Mars with the same arrogance and cultural imposition they’ve used throughout history, leading to conflict and loss.

What I love about The Martian Chronicles is how it uses Mars to dive into these universal human experiences. The characters, whether astronauts or Martians deal with isolation, alienation and the search for identity. Even with all their technology, humans can’t escape their inner loneliness and the Martians face their own existential crisis as they’re displaced by colonization. For me, reading this book is like embarking on a journey through space and time, forcing me to reflect on the choices humanity has made and continues to make.

The book’s themes of war, human fragility and cultural clash are just as relevant today as they were in the 1950s. Bradbury’s storytelling invites us to reflect on our actions and their impact on both Earth and the future we’re striving for in space. The Martian Chronicles is a thought provoking masterpiece that challenges us to think about progress, what we might lose in reaching for the stars and the nature of our shared humanity.

						<p>I absolutely love White Nights by Fyodor Dostoevsky because of its deep exploration of human emotion, loneliness and the complexities of dreams and reality. Set against the backdrop of St. Petersburg’s shimmering, endless summer nights, the novella is a delicate, poignant portrait of a man who feels disconnected from the world around him. The protagonist, an unnamed dreamer, is caught in a cycle of romantic daydreams and unrequited love and Dostoevsky captures this delicate emotional state with such sensitivity and nuance. What I find so compelling is how the story contrasts the protagonist's rich inner world with the stark loneliness of his outer life. His brief encounter with Nastenka, a young woman also caught in a web of longing, offers a glimmer of hope, but the story’s bittersweet ending leaves you reflecting on the nature of idealism, human connection and the pain of unattainable dreams. White Nights is a beautiful, melancholic exploration of the heart's yearning and the fleeting nature of those moments when it feels like anything is possible.

															<p>	When I was a kid, my sister would often burst into fits of laughter while reading P.G. Wodehouse’s books, especially Laughing Gas. At the time, I didn’t quite understand why she found them so funny, but I remember being intrigued by her enjoyment. Fast forward almost 20 years later, I finally decided to dive into one of Wodehouse’s books myself. I picked up Right Ho, Jeeves—and was immediately hooked.

															What drew me in wasn’t just the charm of the characters, though they’re certainly part of the magic. At the heart of the story is the delightful dynamic between Bertie Wooster, the well-meaning but hopelessly bumbling aristocrat, and his ever-competent valet, Jeeves. Bertie’s good intentions always seem to land him in ridiculous situations, but it’s Jeeves who, with a quiet word or a perfectly timed suggestion, untangles the chaos with ease. The two of them make for one of the most endearing literary pairings and their back and forth is a constant source of comedy throughout the novel.

															What really makes Right Ho, Jeeves stand out, though, is Wodehouse’s language. His writing is sharp, playful and full of absurdity. Even the simplest sentence can crack you up. I still find myself chuckling over lines like Bertie’s exaggerated account of his predicaments: “I could see that the thing was going to be a great deal more complicated than I had imagined. What had begun as a mere skirmish was now developing into a battle of the most appalling magnitude.” It’s that kind of humor unabashedly over the top, yet delivered with such a straight face that makes Wodehouse’s prose so unforgettable.

															The plot itself is gloriously ridiculous, filled with romantic misunderstandings, mistaken identities and a lobster on the loose. It’s a madcap world where everything that can go wrong does and the brilliance of the story is in how Wodehouse ties all these absurd threads together. Despite the chaos, everything somehow makes perfect sense, especially when Jeeves steps in to save the day.

															Reading Right Ho, Jeeves is a kind of joyful escape. It’s set in a whimsical, pre World War II England—a world of country estates, eccentric characters and ridiculous social dilemmas. In a way, it doesn’t matter that the world of Bertie and Jeeves is long gone; their timeless appeal and the laugh out loud absurdity of their adventures, make it feel as relevant and entertaining today as ever.

															I first picked up Wodehouse’s work after years of hearing about it and I’m so glad I did. Right Ho, Jeeves remains one of my all time favorites, offering the perfect blend of wit, charm and laugh out loud humor. If you’re looking for a light hearted escape, this book is a perfect choice. You won’t regret it!

																		<p> A mix of history, myth and magical realism, the novel is as ambitious and vivid as Rushdie’s previous works, yet it feels uniquely timely in its exploration of power, storytelling and the rise and fall of empires.

																		At its heart, Victory City is a tale of resilience and revolution. The story follows the creation of the fictional city of Bisnaga, a utopian project driven by the visions of a young woman named Pampa Kampana. Through Pampa’s eyes, we witness the birth of an empire, its glorious peak and its inevitable decline, all woven with a rich tapestry of gods, kings and poetic language.

																		One of the novel’s most fascinating aspects is how Rushdie blends the mythical with the historical. Much of the narrative draws inspiration from the real life Vijayanagara Empire, which once flourished in southern India, particularly under the reign of Sri Krishna Deva Raya. The characters and events in Victory City are often deeply rooted in this period, with Rushdie drawing on actual names, figures and legends from the empire's history. The city of Bisnaga, for instance, mirrors the rise of Vijayanagara and many of the political and cultural dynamics feel familiar to those who are well versed in the history of the empire.

																		Rushdie’s inclusion of these historical figures, from kings and queens to poets and warriors, adds a layer of authenticity to the novel’s fantastical elements. Yet, he doesn’t simply re tell history, he weaves it into a rich narrative tapestry, where the past and present merge. This blending of the real and the imagined gives Victory City an otherworldly, dreamlike quality, all while grounding it in the very real cycles of empire building, ambition and downfall.

																		Rushdie’s prose, as always, is mesmerizing, filled with lush imagery and lyrical wisdom. His exploration of human ambition, the hunger for power and the cycles of history resonates on a deep level, echoing themes of empire-building that feel profoundly relevant in today’s world. The novel’s magical realism allows for a dreamlike quality, blurring the line between myth and reality in a way that only Rushdie can master.

																		What struck me most, though, was how Victory City is a love letter to the art of storytelling itself. Pampa, both the creator and the witness of the city’s rise, is a conduit for myth making, her words become both a weapon and a balm. In a world so often obsessed with tangible power, Victory City reminds us of the enduring strength of stories to shape our destinies and preserve legacies. It’s a meditation on how myth is not just a reflection of reality but a force that can create new worlds.
